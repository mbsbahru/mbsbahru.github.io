## Hello, I'm Bahru!

I'm a marine engineering graduate and robotics enthusiast with hands-on experience in marine robotics, control systems, and computer vision.

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of what I did during my involvement with **Barunastra Roboboat ITS**, **Michigan Robosub**, **Marine Renewable Lab**, and self-directed projects:

### [RoboSub 2024](./projects/mrobosub.md)
Developed efficient detection and localization algorithms for underwater objects in the RoboSub competition.

### [Pose Perfect - Android Pose Estimation](./projects/pose_kalman.md)
Developed an Android app to estimate 3D pose using vision, accelerometer, and gyroscope data.

### [Visual Path Planning for Underwater Manipulation](./projects/path_planning.md)
Developed a Python program to estimate 3D poses of underwater objects relative to a camera.

### [Control Co-Design of VIVACE Renewable Energy Converter](./projects/vivace_ccd.md)
Selected the novel control strategy and designed a comprehensive system model for the VIVACE converter.
