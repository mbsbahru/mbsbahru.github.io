title: Android Touch HSV Color Picker (2014)
---

*Self-project during my role as a junior programmer at Barunastra Roboboat ITS.*

### My Responsibility:
Developed an interactive Android application to segment objects based on their Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color and enable easy selection and adjustment of HSV parameters through a touch interface.

### Strategy:
- Implemented OpenCV for Android to process live camera frames and convert them to HSV color space.
  
- Allowed users to adjust HSV range values dynamically using a touch interface, which triggered updates to filter and display objects based on selected HSV values.

- Detected and highlighted objects in real-time by applying color-based segmentation, while displaying the detected object's features such as Hue, Saturation, and Value.

- Developed interactive SeekBars for adjusting the HSV thresholds and provided live feedback as users refined the settings.

- Designed custom UI components to enable users to touch areas on the live camera feed and retrieve the HSV value of the selected point.

- Used OpenCVâ€™s contour detection to extract object boundaries and provide a visual overlay on detected objects in the camera feed.

- Enabled color calibration through manual selection and tuning of HSV parameters, making the application useful for vision-based robotic applications such as obstacle detection.
