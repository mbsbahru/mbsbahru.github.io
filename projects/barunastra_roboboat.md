title: Object Detection and Communication for 9th International Roboboat Competition (2016)
---

*9th International Roboboat Competition - self-directed project at Barunastra Roboboat ITS.*

**Team:** Rudy D., Darwin S., Yohan P., *Muhammad Bahru Sholahuddin*, Ericza D. S., Anas M. N.

### My Responsibility:
Developed an Android-based object detection system using OpenCV, integrated with external sensors, and designed a communication pipeline between the Android application and a microcontroller via Bluetooth.

### Strategies:
- **Object Detection Pipeline:** Developed a comprehensive detection pipeline using color thresholding, noise reduction (Median and Gaussian filters), and morphological operations (Erosion and Dilation) to segment and refine object boundaries.
- **Object Classification:** Implemented algorithms to classify objects based on Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color space and geometric features such as form factor and number of edges, enabling the system to distinguish between various objects in the competition environment.
- **Performance Testing:** Tested the detection algorithm on recorded videos from the water field using a custom C++ program built with CMake to evaluate system performance.
- **Feature Extraction:** Created individual Java activities for each object type, extracting feature data such as hue, saturation, value, and shape parameters for real-time analysis within the application.
- **Camera Optimization:** Adjusted Android camera settings, including auto-focus, white balance, and exposure, to enhance detection performance under varying outdoor lighting conditions.
- **Sensor Data Integration:** Retrieved and processed raw sensor data from Androidâ€™s GPS, light sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer for orientation data. Designed the system to allow easy resetting of orientation values, improving synchronization with object detection.
- **Microcontroller Communication:** Established communication with an STM32F4 microcontroller via UART over Bluetooth. Designed a custom parsing system to transmit real-time 2D object position data and sensor data (GPS, light, orientation) to the microcontroller for decision-making. Retrieved command data from the microcontroller to update the Android system with mission states.
