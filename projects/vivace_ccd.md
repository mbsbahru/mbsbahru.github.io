In progress research project at the Marine Renewable Energy Lab (MRELab) as part of Master's Thesis.

**Team:** Muhammad Bahru Sholahuddin, Nipit Congpuong (PhD Candidate), Salman Sadiq, Ph.D. (Postdoctoral Fellow), Prof. Michael M. Bernitsas (Advisor).

### My Responsibility:
Selected a novel control strategy and designed a comprehensive system model of the VIVACE (Vortex Induced Vibration Aquatic Clean Energy) marine hydrokinetic converter in Matlab Simulink. Developed the control algorithm, tested the generators, and optimized the damping parameters to improve overall energy harnessing efficiency.

### Strategies:
- **System Modeling:** Designed a complete system model of the VIVACE converter in Matlab Simulink, integrating components such as the hydrodynamic model, spring-mass-damper system, control algorithm, power generation unit, and battery load system for cohesive performance.
- **Hydrodynamic Interaction Modeling:** Modeled hydrodynamic interactions using a deep neural network, trained on a large dataset of experimental measurements to simulate fluid-structure interactions and predict dynamic responses under various flow conditions.
- **Field-Oriented Control (FOC):** Applied FOC with a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor (PMSM) to adjust the damping force dynamically, efficiently converting mechanical energy to electrical energy while adapting to changing flow rates and environmental conditions.
- **System Identification:** Conducted system identification to estimate generator parameters such as flux linkage ($$\lambda$$), internal resistance ($$R$$), and inductances ($$L_q$$ and $$L_d$$), tuning the control system for real-world performance.
- **Generator Testing:** Evaluated real-world generator setups by testing efficiency against rotational speed and power output, selecting the optimal configuration for different operational scenarios.
- **FOC Tuning:** Fine-tuned FOC control gains to ensure stable operation and high efficiency across various environmental and operational conditions.
- **Real-Time Control Algorithm:** Developed a control algorithm capable of real-time adjustment based on instantaneous damping coefficients and generator speed, maintaining optimal performance in fluctuating flow conditions.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Analyzed power output and system efficiency under various test conditions, considering different water flow rates, spring stiffness, and damping coefficients. Created a surrogate model to represent system performance across these variables.
- **Damping Optimization:** Optimized both linear and non-linear damping parameters using meta-heuristic algorithms like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) to maximize energy extraction in diverse environmental conditions.
